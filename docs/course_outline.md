## Black Belt: Functions & OOP (Final Belt)
*Goal: Write clean, reusable, and structured code by creating functions and classes.*

1.  **Defining Functions:** The `def` keyword.
2.  **Function Arguments:** Passing data into functions.
3.  **Return Values:** Getting data *out* of functions.
4.  **Variable Scope:** Local vs. Global variables.
5.  **What is OOP?:** The concept of Classes and Objects.
6.  **Creating a Class:** The `class` keyword and `__init__()`.

8.  **Inheritance:** Making a new class based on an existing one.
9.  **Error Spotlight:** The `AttributeError`.
10. **Black Belt Promotion Challenge:** Write a **`Car` class** with `__init__()` and a method. The `__init__` should store `make`, `model`, and `year`. The method, called `get_info()`, should **return a string** like "2025 Ford Mustang".
