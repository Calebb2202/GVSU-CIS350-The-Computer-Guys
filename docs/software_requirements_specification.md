# Overview

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the features, goals, and constraints for the "Syntax Sensei" project. Its purpose is to provide a clear, shared understanding for the development team of what the software will do and how it will perform.

# Functional Requirements

## 1. User Account Management
1.  The system shall allow users to access and complete lessons without creating an account (guest mode).
2.  The system shall not save any lesson progress for users in guest mode.
3.  The system shall allow a user to register and log in using their existing Google account (Single Sign-On).
4.  The system shall, upon first login, offer the user an optional proficiency quiz to place them in an appropriate "belt" section.
5.  The system shall allow a logged-in user to log out.
6.  The system shall save all lesson and belt progress only for users logged in with their Google account.

## 2. User Progression Dashboard ("Belt System")
1.  The system shall provide a dedicated dashboard page, accessible only to logged-in users, which displays their current "belt" rank.
2.  The system shall organize lessons into "belt" sections (e.g., "White Belt Section," "Yellow Belt Section").
3.  The system shall display a list of all completed lessons for the logged-in user on their dashboard.
4.  The system shall lock all lessons in a higher "belt" section until the user has passed the "Final Coding Challenge" for the prerequisite belt.
5.  The system shall automatically promote a logged-in user to the next belt rank after they successfully pass the "Final Coding Challenge."

## 3. Lesson Module
1.  The system shall present lessons containing multiple-choice questions.
2.  The system shall present lessons containing fill-in-the-blank questions.
3.  The system shall present lessons containing error-checking questions, which require the user to identify an error's line and type from drop-down menus.
4.  The system shall provide immediate feedback (e.g., "Correct" or "Incorrect") to the user after they submit an answer to a question.
5.  The system shall store the completion status of each lesson only for users who are logged in.
6.  The system shall lock all lessons within a belt section until the preceding lesson is completed.

## 4. Final Coding Challenge (IDE)
1.  The system shall present a text editor interface for the user to write Python code.
2.  The system shall provide a "Run Code" button that executes the user's code against a predefined input.
3.  The system shall display the output (`stdout`) generated by the user's code execution in a console window.
4.  The system shall provide a "Submit Answer" button that validates the user's code output against one or more hidden test cases.
5.  The system shall display a "Pass" message and unlock the next belt section upon a successful submission.
6.  The system shall display a "Fail" message, indicating which test case failed, upon an unsuccessful submission.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. User Account Management
1.  The system shall securely implement the Google OAuth 2.0 (Single Sign-On) protocol to authenticate users.
2.  The login page and proficiency quiz shall load in under 2 seconds when run locally.

## 2. User Progression Dashboard ("Belt System")
1.  The application shall be designed for and functional on desktop screen resolutions with a minimum width of 1280 pixels.
2.  The progression graphics (e.g., belt images) shall render correctly on the latest versions of Google Chrome and Firefox.

## 3. Lesson Module
1.  The lesson interface shall be navigable using only a keyboard (Tab to navigate, Enter to select).
2.  The system shall provide feedback to user interactions (e.g., submitting an answer) in under 500 milliseconds.

## 4. Final Coding Challenge (IDE)
1.  The code editor interface shall provide Python syntax highlighting.
2.  The code execution environment shall impose a 5-second timeout on user code execution to prevent infinite loops.
3.  The code execution environment shall be sandboxed to prevent network access or local file system access.
