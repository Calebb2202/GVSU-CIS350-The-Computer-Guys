Date: October 23, 2025

Time: 2:00pm - 2:35pm

Discussion points:

* Presentation Feedback: eye contact with audience, presenter should be the main focus not the presentation, and make sure presentation is readable
* Future meetings will implement SCRUM. We will each share what we worked on for the week, what we will work on, and any problems that may arise
* talked about how progression will be implemented for our website, and generally agreed on a straightforward linear progression not being able to access future lessons unless previous lessons are completed. (prvious lessons can be completed by skip lesson button, doing the lesson, or "testing out")

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* bringing code for "template" of project
* After code is brought over work on design of project (adding assets, changing layout of template, etc.)
* Also after code is brought over work implementing Google sign in and plugging it into database
